        <p> We are using a standard 12 column fluid responsive grid system. 
            The grid helps you layout your page in an ordered, easy fashion

        <h3 class="red-text text-lighten-2">Blockqoutes</h3>
        <p>Blockquotes are mainly used to give emphasis to a quote or citation. 
            You can also use these for some extra text hierarchy and emphasis.</p>
        
        <blockquote>This is an example quotation that uses the blockquote tag.
            Here is another line to make it look bigger. </blockquote>

                One common flaw we've seen in many frameworks is a lack of support 
                for truly responsive text. While elements on the page resize fluidly, 
                text still resizes on a fixed basis. To ameliorate this problem, 
                for text heavy pages, we've created a class that fluidly scales 
                text size and line-height to optimize readability for the user.
                <br> 
                Line length stays between 45-80 characters and line height scales to be 
                larger on smaller screens.
